# Procedures

# Define a procedure, sum3, that takes three
# inputs, and returns the sum of the three
# input numbers.
# To help you out, the code for sum(a,b) is below.

# Example:

print sum3(1,2,3) # >>> 6 
print sum3(93,53,70) # >>> 216

# Answer:

def sum3(a, b, c): return a + b + c

x=1  y=2  z=3

print sum3(x, y, z)
